# STM32L4-based motor controller
I built some motor controller hardware, and I wanted to use an open-source toolchain to make it go.

## Build and debug prerequisites
* scons
* gcc-arm-none-eabi
* gdb-arm-none-eabi
* [stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink)

## Shoutouts
* [xpcc](https://github.com/roboterclubaachen/xpcc/), which taught me a great deal about SCons in an embedded context.
* Seth LaForge, from whom I liberally stole compiler flags.
